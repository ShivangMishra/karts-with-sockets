# karts-with-sockets
<h3> A 2D multiplayer karts game using sockets in Java</h3>

The main concepts covered in this project are- 
- socekts & i/o streams 
- multithreading 
- swing & awt
- Basic OOP & numerical modelling

The project is divided into three sections- 
1. The first section involves <strong>the karts design and basic controls </strong>. 
2. The second section is a <strong>local 2 player karts game</strong> (where both the players play on the same machine with different keys).
3. The third section extends the prototype developed in the second section into a <strong>network based game</strong> (in which multiple clients can connect to a server using socket connections). 

Refer to each section's readme and the javadoc comments for further details.

Note - This is not a polished game meant to be played but actually just a weekend project to refresh my networking and multithreading concepts in Java. 
Therefore, I have not added trivial stuff like game menus and win/lose logic. For the sake of simplicity, I have not stressed on Design patterns, however the code is <em>easily readable, well documented and conforms to Java standards and OOP paradigm</em>.

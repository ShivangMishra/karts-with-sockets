* JDK 16 was used in development.
* 
* GameServer.java is used to run the game server.
* GameServer has an intuitive UI for specifying port. It also has a transcript that shows the communication log in a
  human readable form, to assist debugging.
* GameClient.java is used to run a client.
* GameClient has an intuitive user interface for connecting/disconnecting the client to the server.
* 
* When a client is not connected to the server, the player can still play around with their own kart. As soon as the
  client connects to the server, the kart positions are updated according to the other players connected to the server.
* 
* The game can be used for multiple clients with some minor changes, but currently only upto two clients have been
  tested.
* The code is well documented.
